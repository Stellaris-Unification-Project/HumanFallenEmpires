 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.0.1:0 "Interesting! You have found our ancient subspace passage. You do not mind if we close it, right?"
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.1:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by §PAhets§! to be used for building a colony. Half a year had passed when The §PRa§! himself in his blazing chariot led the rebellion and unleashed his wrath on our foes. He destroyed the §PAhet§! colonial ship, dealing a crushing blow to their morale.\nTheir survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.2:0 "Wir kämpften und gewannen unsere Freiheit und waren stolz auf unseren Sieg, aber Stolz wurde zur Arroganz und wir vergaßen allmählich unsere Götter. Vom Wissensdurst verzehrt, drängten uns unsere Ambitionen in jeden Winkel des Universums. Es war das Goldene Zeitalter der Zivilisation unseres Volkes, denn wir lösten viele Geheimnisse des Universums, besuchten faszinierende Welten und bauten wunderbare Städte, an Orten wo das Leben einst unmöglich gewesen wäre.\nWir fanden sogar unsere alte Heimatwelt, im §PSol System§! und auf dem schönen Planeten §PEarth§! fanden wir die Überreste unserer Art in ihrem primitiven Zustand, die wir nicht stören wollten."

 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.3.1:0 "Soon, the Gods put us to another trial. We faced a great foe, a detestable race we dubbed the Cylons, but whom you probably know as the Daleks. Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. The primitive nuclear and biological weapons of our enemy turned the planet into a desert. But in the end, we defeated and purged these creatures from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.4:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained - of who we are and that only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh,§! the prophet of §PRa,§! we welcome the New Life."

 human_fallen_empires.100.desc:0 "Most of the planet's surface is covered with various smoke-belching factories. It would appear that some of them are being used as places of worship. Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, the replacement of the breathing filter has become an obligatory part of the morning religious ritual. Even simpler safety procedures such as wearing face-masks to allow them to breath safely have gained religious signifigance."

 human_fallen_empires.104.0.response:0 "Year 386 after The Fall. Possibly I am the last of the engineer corps. I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelez,§! were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed path with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. Turns out, we were the weaker ones. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."

 human_fallen_empires.104.1.response:0 "The remains of our kind began to rebuild our cities, but we were changed by the stress of defeat and the looming fear that one day the §PJu Ahet§! may come back. We had no interest for stars anymore. A cult spread throughout our ranks, claiming that our knowlege became the reason of our defeat. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this damned cult was not in charge.\nThe last of our production modules became their godforge, "Factory", closed and forbidden. They became the only source of science in our midst, hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching "doctrine of Forgetness" instead of physics and maths. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that one day i might serve my people once again."

Suprisingly, it is still fully-functional. There is an information terminal in the center of the room.\nOne of our scientists managed to activate the terminal. The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that it was necessary to not save embalmed bodies, as their tradition say, but instead to save all information about them, including a mold of the deceased individual. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix of the personality of a young man. The personality was transfered to our terminal."

The pictures gradually become more gloomy. Information network... rumors of war... oppressive expectations... attempts to convince oneself that everything will go well and the Great Pharaoh knows what he is doing... . The flashing imagery takes an even greater turn for the worse. The crimson skies blossomed with flashes of thousands of warp jumps arriving in orbit... increasing despair... rumble as which everything inside grows cold... you are so young... .

In the process of studying the terminal, scientists accidentally activate the complex and release the forces locked in it.\nAs a result of the careless actions of our research group, the planet was captured by something aggressive and taciturn.
