 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.2:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by §PAhets§! to be used for building a colony. Half a year had passed when The §PRa§! himself in his blazing chariot led the rebellion and unleashed his wrath on our foes. He destroyed the §PAhet§! colonial ship, dealing a crushing blow to their morale.\nTheir survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.3:0 "Nous nous sommes battus et avons gagné notre liberté, fiers de notre victoire, mais la fierté est devenue arrogance et nous avons progressivement oublié nos dieux. Consummé par la soif de la connaissance, nous avons poussé nos ambitions dans tous les coins de l'Univers. C'était l'âge d'or de la civilisation de notre peuple, car nous avons démêlé beaucoup de mystères de l'Univers, visité des mondes fascinants et construit des villes merveilleuses où la vie été impossible.\nNous avons même localisé notre ancien monde natal, dans le §PSol System§!, et sur une magnifique planète §PEarth§! nous avons trouvé les restes de notre espèce dans leur état primitif, que nous avons décidé de ne pas déranger."
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.4:0 "Soon, the Gods put us to another trial. We faced a great foe, a detestable race we dubbed the §PCylons§!, but whom you probably know as the §PDaleks.§! Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. The primitive nuclear and biological weapons of our enemy turned the planet into a desert. But in the end, we defeated and purged these bastards from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 human_fallen_empires.47.desc.5:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained — of who we are and that only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh§!, the prophet of §PRa§! and bathing in the light of Ra, we welcome the New Life."

Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, the replacement of the breathing filter has become an obligatory part of the morning religious ritual.

I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelez§!, were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed path with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. Turns out, we were the weaker ones. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."
 human_fallen_empires.104.1:0 "Replay fragment 2."
 human_fallen_empires.104.1.response:0 "The remains of our kind began to rebuild our cities, but we were changed by the stress of defeat and the looming fear that one day the §PJu Ahet§! may come back. We had no interest for stars anymore. A cult spread throughout our ranks, claiming that our knowlege became the reason of our defeat. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this damned cult was not in charge.\nThe last of our production modules became their godforge, "Factory", closed and forbidden. They became the only source of science in our midst, hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching "doctrine of Forgetness" instead of physics and maths. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that one day i might serve my people once again."

Suprisingly, it is still fully-functional. There is an information terminal in the center of the room.\nOne of our scientists managed to activate the terminal. The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that it was necessary to not save embalmed bodies, as their tradition say, but instead to save all information about them, including a mold of the deceased individual. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix of the personality of a young man. The personality was transfered to our terminal."

Information network... rumors of war... oppressive expectations... attempts to convince oneself that everything will go well and the Great Pharaoh knows what he is doing... . The flashing imagery takes an even greater turn for the worse. The crimson skies blossomed with flashes of thousands of warp jumps arriving in orbit... increasing despair... rumble as which everything inside grows cold... you are so young... .

And before I follow them, I will make this record, in the hope that someone will find it and remember the people of Brunen Gee."
 human_fallen_empires.5056.0.response:0 "It's been only 3 cycles since our civilization mastered faster-than-light space travel. Everybody was full of enthusiasm. For so long have we been dreaming of exploration of the nearest stars, discovering new forms of life. A number of first expeditions were successful. Our zoos and laboratories were being filled with various species of hominidae, plants, even certain not-so-well-developed reptiles.\nBut one cycle ago, aboard one of our ships, we brought back something... not on the ship's register, something unimaginably strange. A fascinating parasite. A §PWorm§!, which would enter the very mind of its host and control it entirely. It was impossible to detect. The victim would remain conscious, not feeling any discomfort. The paraste would gain access to all of the host's memories and skills to use them to its own interests. Remarkably, it would even enter those with the third brain severely damaged. Untreatable patients were getting cured. Elderly were getting younger. Those infected with the dredded cold got a second chance. Clueless as to what was going on, we called it extraordinarily-induced genetic anomaly."
 human_fallen_empires.5056.1.response:0 "Soon, hundreds of thousands of infected citizens came out declaring themselves a new race, claiming proper rights and privileges.\nWarmongering was never a part of our culture, and eradicating us never was the worms' goal. It was just that the more developed the nervous system of the host, the more it is suitable for the parasite. And our species happened to be the only one really suitable on the planet. We dubbed them "neighbours".\nWe made it work. We allocated cities for our "neighbours" to occupy, sending there the uncurable patients and the elderly, and the "neighbours" in return promised us to control their population and to take bodies only by consent."
 human_fallen_empires.5056.2.response:0 "Half a cycle ago unknown ships orbited our planet. "Neighbors" screamed and cried, thousands rushed to the spaceports trying to fly away. The image of these ships was hidden deep inside their genetic memory, but no one managed to escape.\nWithout any warning, the ships opened fire. For several days, flames poured out of their gun ports as an endless stream. The planet was literally sterilized. All our dreams... all our ideas about us... about our place in the universe... all our gods... burned in this fire. At the station we saw a terrible but fascinating sight, as everything that we knew was dying, and it was not in our power to stop it.\nThe planet shone like the sun.\nThis was the end of the world."
