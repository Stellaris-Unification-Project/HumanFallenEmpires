On my urgent recommendation, we seized several dozen settlements to use them during the initial stages of the forthcoming colonization. Perhaps the members of the Council were surprised when I volunteered to organize the placement and control of these savages aboard the ship.\nThe unfortunate and rapid decline of healthy §PAhet§! on our planet meant that, fortunately for the primities, the ship had plenty of empty seating, largely due to the ineffective and cowardly policies of the Council leading our civilization to further collapse before my plan had matured from out of my brilliant mind.

A fascinating parasite. A §PWorm§!, which would enter the very mind of its host and control it entirely. It was impossible to detect. The victim would remain conscious, not feeling any discomfort. The paraste would gain access to all of the host's memories and skills to use them to its own interests. Remarkably, it would even enter those with the third brain severely damaged.

I am this huge station.\nLet me explain, according to my calculations, I do not have long to live, why not explain something to someone before I die?\nOnce upon a time, I was young and alive. Or was it? However, my mind is only copied, so somewhere among the majestic pyramids and to this day can create an extraordinary mind. At least they did not bother to send me a greeting for our 500th anniversary. So that you know, this is a very important day in the life of everyone §PJu Ahet.§! In general, I do not want to deal with her. Or with him.\nIt does not matter, the need for new types of weapons has grown in the Great War. That's why they made me a huge computer.\nI quickly got tired of inventing new weapons (and I also figured out that they would get rid of me at the end of the war), so I escaped and decided to devote myself to the eternal problems of the universe.\nBy the way, did your race come to an answer to the question of the meaning of life?"
