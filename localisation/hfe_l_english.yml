 hfe.47.desc.0.0:0 "Greetings, New Life! We see your high potential and expect great deeds from you. To achieve the unity of thought between us, in form and goals, let us share with you our history and world views."
 hfe.47.desc.0.1:0 "Interesting! You have found our ancient subspace passage. You do not mind if we close it, right? Don't worry, we'll send you home when we're through."
 hfe.47.desc.1:0 "We have not always been like this. To become who we are today, we had to be forged through blood and despair. Millenia ago, our primitive ancestors were kidnapped by a sinister race called the §PAhets,§! to be used for building a colony. Stolen from our homelands and pressed into slavery, we had prepared to resign ourselves to hopelessness. Just when we had given up, we were suddenly freed, and the colony hadn't even been fullly established! Short time of our enslavement had passed when §PRa§! Himself, in His blazing chariot, led a rebellion and unleashed His Wrath on our foes! With His help, we destroyed the colonial ship-turned-capitol and slaughtered our former masters.\nThe remaining Ahet survivors were put to labor and our people utilized what was left of their technology to progress our civilization. So our journey began."
 hfe.47.desc.2:0 "We fought and won our freedom, taking pride in our victory, but pride became arrogance and we gradually forgot our gods. Consumed by the thirst for knowledge, we pushed our ambitions to every corner of the galaxy. It was the Golden Age of our people's civilization, for we unraveled many mysteries of the universe. We visited fascinating worlds and built wonderful cities where life had once been impossible.\nOne thousand years ago, we finally located our ancient homeworld, in the §PSol System,§! and on the beautiful planet §PEarth§! we found the remnants of our kind in a primitive state, and we decided not to disturb them. We haven't visited Sol since then."
 hfe.47.desc.3.0.0.0:0 "This is sad news."
 hfe.47.desc.3.0.0.1:0 "This is bad news. Pehaps the §PGreat Pharaoh§! needs to step in."
 hfe.47.desc.3.0.1:0 "However, back to the narrative.\n"
 hfe.47.desc.3.1:0 "Soon, the Gods put us to another trial. We faced a great foe, a detestable race we dubbed the Cylons, but whom you probably know as the Daleks. Our great nation stood up to defend the Galaxy. In the end, we defeated and purged these creatures from everywhere under the light of §PRa.§!"
 hfe.47.desc.4:0 "Much knowledge had been lost, but more important was the memory reattained - of who we are. Only under the protection of true gods and eternal values could our dreams shape this universe. Thus reborn from ashes, we lit a new sun, built colonies anew and raised the pyramids. Under the guidance of the §PGreat Pharaoh,§! the prophet of §PRa,§! we welcome the New Life."

 hfe.100.name:0 "After the War"
 hfe.100.desc:0 "Most of the planet's surface is covered with various smoke-belching factories. It would appear that some of them are being used as places of worship. Huge craters from explosions, resembling bruises and sores, are scattered across the landscape. Most likely they are remnants of a global war that raged here centuries ago.\nBecause of extreme pollution, there is little to no vegetation except for several pieces of land covered by protective domes. The oceans and rivers are filled with toxins and rusty scraps of metal. The atmosphere is unsuitable for unaided breathing due to the high level of contamination. Toxic smoke emits from thousands of factories that the world's population considers a manifestation of the divine, and so they continue to keep them running without producing anything. Despite the extreme airborne toxicity, they have adapted, and according to our agents, even mundane maintenance like the replacement of the breathing filters have become part of the society's elaborate religious rituals. Likewise, simpler safety procedures such as wearing face-masks to allow the population to breathe safely have gained religious signifigance."

 hfe.102.name:0 "Filters"
 hfe.102.desc:0 "Our research teams have uncovered more about this society. Apparently, this world is governed by a theocracy: a §HCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God,§! led a supreme, temporal spiritual ruler whose name, in the [root.GetAdj] language, translates to §H"High Mechanicus".§! One of the spies assigned to study the natives managed to seize a shipment of spare filters for us to study, which revealed a surprising secret. All of the population's air filters are spiked with drugs! Every filter contains a potent mixture that our scientists have dubbed Valerian, which causes severe hallucinations when inhaled. The population's regular "revelations of the gods" turned out to be nothing more than t he result of a mind-altering substance! Unnoticed by the population, we have made contact with the High Mechanicus and have revealed his secret. He knows that releasing this information to the public may destroy the Cult.\n\nThe High Mechanicus is now our puppet. How are we going go exploit this?"

 hfe.103.desc:0 "Our research teams have been allowed to enter the vault of the spiritual headquarters of the Cult. The §H[species.GetName]§! spy who found out about the filters lead the way, and he has unearthed an ancient tablet that turns out to be a portable database that belongs to a high-ranking clergyman of the planetary cult. Unfortunately, its hard drive has suffered irreparable damage after centuries of misuse. Still, our scientists have managed to recover bits of information, and one piece of the data is of particular interest."

 hfe.104.desc:0 "§BYou witness a creatire of a species called the Varelez, wearing clothing woven from adaptive material and without his breathing mask. His eyes are full of sorrow, yet he exudes immense wisdom.§!"
 hfe.104.0:0 "Replay fragment 1."
 hfe.104.0.response:0 "Year 386 after The Fall. Possibly I am the last of the Engineer corps. I record this so that those who come after will remember that we, the §PVarelez,§! were a proud and ambitious race. We reached for the stars and strived to know as much as we can. We've been curious, fearless and aspiring. Once on our journeys, we crossed paths with the §PJu Ahet§! civilization. A trail of misunderstandings, combined with a little of our pride and overconfidence, led to a great war which consumed hundreds of star systems. Turns out, we were the weaker ones. This planet was our last bastion, but eventually we had nothing to defend it with. In hopes of surviving the fiery Hell unleashed by their fleet, we descended into caves. Years later, they finally left our planet."
 hfe.104.1:0 "Replay fragment 2."
 hfe.104.1.response:0 "The remains of our kind began to rebuild our cities, but we were changed by the stress of defeat and the looming fear that one day the §PJu Ahet§! may come back. We had no interest for stars anymore. A §PCult of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God§! spread throughout our ranks, claiming that our knowlege became the reason of our defeat, and that, as penance, our production modules must be converted to machines that will cloud the atmosphere and convince the §HJu Ahet§! that we no longer remained alive. We listened to them willingly, trying to forget our loss. In time, there was no place among us where this accursed cult was not in charge. \nThe greatest of our production modules became their §PGodforge,§! simply called §P"The Factory",§! now closed and forbidden. That became the only source of science in our midst. The Cult then began hunting down and executing any surviving engineers, and teaching a "doctrine of Forgetness" instead of education. I am unable to change anything. Most of my comrades are gone or deceased. My only choice is to freeze myself in cryostasis, chasing the hope that, one day, I might serve and enlighten my people once again."
 hfe.104.2:0 "Interesting."
 hfe.104.2.response:0 "In addition to the mournful chronicles, there was a lot of technical information in the tablet that was useful to our scientists. Meanwhile, the Cult has changed the chemical makeup of the filters, so our outdated information can no longer prove the Cult was lying."

 hfe.107.desc:0 "Publishing this info almost immediately started a civil war across the planet. The clergy of the Machine-That-Speaks-To-God were slaughtered and the High Mechanicus was lynched at the citadel gates. This allowed the opposition to take over, and anticlerical forces came to rule. It seems the Varelez are now ready to return to reason and sense. There is a long process of asking the right questions and seeking answers ahead. How to fix the biosphere? How do machines work if not with the help of the divine? Is there any life beyond our world? However, these troubles are no longer ours."

We have seemed to gain the High Mechanicus' trust and he has developed a fondness for said agent. From this day on, our agent sits at the right-hand of the High Mechanicus' throne as his enforcer, confidante, and friend."

 hfe.151.desc:0 "Scientists carefully explore all the corridors of the pyramid and discover a hidden door in the lower part. Inside, they find something like a data center. Suprisingly, it is still fully-functional. There is an information terminal in the center of the room.\nOne of our scientists managed to activate the terminal. The analysis showed that the pyramid is a huge isolated database. Apparently, those who built this pyramid believed that it was necessary to not save embalmed bodies, as their tradition say, but instead to save all information about them, including a mold of the deceased individual. The last block of this peculiar burial ground contains a matrix of the personality of a young, male alien. The personality was transfered to our terminal."

The pictures gradually become more gloomy. Information network... rumors of war... oppressive expectations... attempts to convince oneself that everything will go well and the Great Pharaoh knows what he is doing... . The flashing imagery takes an even greater turn for the worse. The crimson skies blossomed with flashes of thousands of warp jumps arriving in orbit... increasing despair... rumble as which everything inside grows cold... you are so young... . The last image is of unbearable pain and snow-white flowers, devoured by flame. You disconnect the terminal, horrified from what you just witnessed. It was as if you experienced your own death."
 hfe.152.0:0 "Peculiar."

Judging by the report, among those "buried" in the pyramid were scientists, philosophers and high-ranking officials with all their knowledge and experience.

The still-working terminal flickers in the center of the room. In the process of studying the terminal, scientists accidentally activate the complex and release the forces locked in it.\nAs a result of the careless actions of our research group, the planet was captured by something aggressive and taciturn.

 hfe.556.desc.0:0 "I am §H[ruler.GetName], [root.GetRulerTitle]§! of one of the most powerful empires of the galaxy, and this one of those nights when I do not sleep, reflecting on the past and the future of my people.\nAll in this room is a significant part of my memories. In a vase in the corner, the Desert Lily is blooming - an amazing plant, as if cut from obsidian, found by myself on §H[hfe_555_dry_planet.GetName]§! and able to exist completely without water. On the wall nearby is the rare phaser of my grandfather, which faithfully served him for many years. And my feet are buried in the fibers donated by the ambassador of §H[hfe_555_friendly_relation.GetName]§! carpet, decorated with intricate, changing colors at different times of the day pattern. But the most valuable thing lurked in the corner of the room: my faithful friend, Jean Luc. We met at §H[hfe_555_ocean_planet.GetName]§! during one of my business trips before I accepted my current position. He is a sensible cephalopod and the last of his kind of great warriors, whose glory raged throughout the galaxy thousands of years ago. Probably, there is no other creature in the whole galaxy to whom I could trust more.\nBut this night, disturbing thoughts do not leave me. Something was wrong."
 hfe.556.desc.1:0 "There was a noise outside the door, a sound like a shot, then a romp and silence. I called the guard, after a moment the door to the room opened. Something resembling a person was on the threshold, but judging by the part of the face burned by the blaster, it was not at all.\nWith the remnants of the synthetic skin of the face I had difficulty, but recognized the head of the research mission on the planet §H[hfe_memorial_planet.GetName]§! disappeared quite recently, but it seems that even then a person was replaced by something more deadly, apparently created by the previous owners of the planet, §PJu Ahet.§!\nThe ancient robot looks at me through the dying remains of synthetic skin. One of the hands is missing, and the other in my eyes turns into a blade. There is no doubt about his intentions: he is here to kill me.\nI'm unarmed, standing niar the window. The output is blocked by the android. What should I do?"
 # option 0
 hfe.556.desc.2.0:0 "I scream a code signal, Jean Luc awakens from sleep and activates his implants. Running away, I hear the explosion of a micro-rocket, the hiss of acid and the blade strike my best friend’s body."
 hfe.556.desc.2.0.0:0 "I run down the corridor past the bodies of the dead guards and suddenly stumble over something. This is the standard energy rifle of our troops. I hear footsteps and try to aim and shoot, but too slowly ..."
 hfe.556.desc.2.0.1:0 "I'm sorry. But his duty is to protect his commander, and my duty is to erase all the memories of §PJu Ahet§!!\nNo, all the ancient races will pay for what happened this night!"
 # option 1
 hfe.556.desc.2.1:0 "I rush to the exit, I manage to dodge the blow and slip into the doorway. I run, I hear the monster’s hollow tread behind my back, at least Jean Luc will remain alive, it’s my duty as a commander."
 hfe.556.desc.2.1.0.0:0 "Turn, another turn, the stairs, again the stairs. At the exit of the building is another guard post, I would just get there."
 hfe.556.desc.2.1.0.1:0 "From the darkness of the next intersection there is a disfigured face, tattered synthetic leather and a brilliant grin of too perfect teeth, a knife spark, a dazzling pain in my side, blood, blood, my blood is filling the corridor, tears involuntarily splash out of my eyes, it turns out that great rulers die like ordinary people - in a pool of own blood."
 hfe.556.desc.2.1.1:0 "It is unlikely that he would be useful in this battle, most likely they were from this time with this robot.\nThe turn, another turn, a ladder, again a ladder, another turn and I raid on a detachment of armed guards, their faces are concerned, apparently they were going to find out situation in the destroyed post.\nIn a few words, I retell what happened, the commander calls for reinforcements, two privates take me away, while the rest of the detachment covers the retreat."
 # option 2
 hfe.556.desc.2.2:0 "I look around for something to help me. Glance falls on the grandfather's phaser hanging on the wall, about three meters away. Small chance. I don't even know if it is charged. Grandpa handed it to me with a smile and wished that I did not have to use it. But I have no choice. If only it was charged.\nI shout a code signal, Jean Luc awakens from his sleep and activates his implants. I rush to the shotgun."
 hfe.556.desc.3:0 "It’s as if I'm watching from the outside what is happening. My body has not forgotten for many years of service, a rapid jerk - and a vase with a Desert Lily flies to the head of the terminator, and viscous sand of §H[hfe_555_dry_planet.GetName]§! is covered by its visual sensors. Jean-Luc shoots a microdrive into the droid's torso and jumps on his arm, releasing his acid claws. I tear off the phaser from the wall and with a few confident movements translate it into battle mode, the quiet pleasant sound of an accumulating charge fills me with hope."
 hfe.556.desc.3.0:0 "The Terminator, finally coping with the Desert Lily, throws Jean Luc off his hand and rushes towards me, sending the phaser in his direction, and I pull the trigger, but nothing happens. I don’t have time to be surprised, because with one jerk the robot is near and cuts me into two unequal parts."
 hfe.556.desc.3.1:0 "The Terminator, finally coping with the Desert Lily, throws Jean Luc off his hand and rushes towards me, sending the phaser in his direction, and I pull the trigger once, again, again and again - flashes of blue flame are pouring out of the old weapon, making holes and discarding stubborn death machine, I shoot again and again, until on a wonderful §Hhfe_555_friendly_relation.species.GetName]§! carpet ruin a crumpled, burning-out skeleton of what was once an ancient death machine. Jean-Luc has already activated the first-aid kit, I am even a little ashamed that I did not get any injuries."

Fighting our way through the red zone, our fathers knew the bitterness of loss.\nThe universe had its own plans, however. On the way, they flew through a hyper-dimensional anomaly and travelled to the past. The attempt to prevent or somehow change the future will lead to disastrous consequences.

Before I follow them, I will make this record, in the hope that someone will find it and remember the people of Brunen Gee."
 hfe.5056.0.response:0 "It's been only three cycles since our civilization mastered faster-than-light space travel. Everybody was full of enthusiasm. For so long we had drempt of exploration of the nearest stars and discovering new forms of life. A number of first expeditions were successful. Our zoos and laboratories were being filled with various species of mammals, plants and even certain not-so-well-developed reptiles.\nBut one cycle ago, aboard one of our ships, we brought back something... not on the ship's register.\nSomething unimaginably strange. A fascinating parasite. A §PWorm,§! which would enter the very mind of its host and control it entirely. It was impossible to detect. The victim would remain conscious, not feeling any discomfort. The paraste would gain access to all of the host's memories and skills to use them to its own interests. Remarkably, it would even enter those with the third brain severely damaged. Untreatable patients were getting cured. Elderly were getting younger. Those infected with the dredded cold got a second chance. Clueless as to what was going on, we called it extraordinarily-instigated genetic anomaly."
 hfe.5056.1.response:0 "Soon, hundreds of thousands of infected citizens came out declaring themselves a new race, claiming proper rights and privileges.\nWarmongering was never a part of our culture, and eradicating us never was the worms' goal. It was just that the more developed the nervous system of the host, the more it is suitable for the parasite. Our species happened to be the only one really suitable on the planet. We dubbed them "neighbours".\nWe made it work. We allocated cities for our "neighbours" to occupy, sending there the uncurable patients and the elderly, and the "neighbours" in return promised us to control their population and to take bodies only by consent."
 hfe.5056.2.response:0 "Half a cycle ago, unknown ships orbited our planet. "Neighbors" screamed and cried, thousands rushed to the spaceports trying to fly away. The image of these ships was hidden deep inside their genetic memory, but no one managed to escape.\nWithout any warning, the ships opened fire. For several days, flames poured out of their gun ports as an endless stream. The planet was literally sterilized. All our dreams... all our ideas about us... about our place in the universe... all our gods... burned in this fire. At the station we saw a terrible but fascinating sight, as everything that we knew was dying, and it was not in our power to stop it.\nThe planet shone like the sun.\nThis was the end of the world."

These new "pastures" feed vast herds of military contraptions controlled by automatic tactical command centers from the last war. The command centers create various military and scout probe-shells to destroy opponents competing for the pastures. However, compared to the predators these command centers are mere herbivores. It is unknown if the predators were created by the extinct civilization or were a random product of natural selection or of the arms race between the cuckoo robots. What is known is that they killed half of the [root.hfe_scripted_loc_crew] before §H[root.leader.GetName]§! ordered to stop the active exploration stage.\n\n§H[root.leader.GetName]§! advises to build an orbital research station to study what is happening on the planet and hopes to replenish the pool of privates in the nearest port."

However, having gathered into huge clouds of dozens of billions of them they form a brain, with each element connected to a number of neighbors, capable of generating magnetic field and thrust. This enables a big enough electromagnetic pulse cloud to destroy the electronic components of any machine (or even the neural system of a living being) and to cover great distances in search for nourishment.\nIt remains uncrlear what caused the attack of predators on the research staff since all biological life on the planed was eradicated hundreds of years ago."

 hfe_ssm_discovery:0 "This planet can no longer be our home, nor should it be.\n\nArcheologists confirmed what we already knew from the legends: our ancestors came from the stars, and our civilization emerged from the ruins immeasurably more advanced.\nWhat if new technologies conflict with the old traditions? What if evolution gives way to revolution? What if superiority is sufficient enough to find a fragment of an ancient computer?\n\nWhatever it was, the answer was wrong. Disharmony of social development and technological innovation resulted in chaos that the civilization was not ready for. Our planet fell and mny died.\n\nThe survivors have created a new formation. We have won over their primitive prejudices and built a more perfect society. Hundreds of years have gone into studying the fragments of the technology of the forerunners. Hundreds of years of waiting in sleep until the mechanical servants built §PDiscovery.§!\n\n This planet can no longer be our home, nor should it be, and now, with §PDiscovery's§! fleet in orbit, we have installed the first hyperdrives. The stars themselves are finally within our grasp!"

 personality_hfe_personality_ahet_primitive_0_desc:0 "'Panarchy" refers to the concept of an individual's right to choose any form of government without being forced to move from their current locale. This is sometimes described as "extra-territorial", since governments often would serve non-contiguous parcels of land, even down to individual homes and neighborhoods. This society attempted this experiment and, for some time, had success. However, that ideal is long gone and the individuals are now trapped in their states. The original experiment, coupled with weak technical development, forms a peculiar mix of competing governments, with no single monopoly of force or unification present. On this planet, oligarchic corporate empires coexist with feudal slave trading communes and bloody anarcho-femenist syndicates.\nTherapists fulfill the role of clergy."

Deeming itself the only species worthy of ruling the galaxy, but unable to do so in its natural body, Brain Worms instead locate and infects a host- the vessel -and from there, what happens depends on the type and "personality" of the Brain Worm host. \nBrain Worms can range from a benevolent but seriously paternalistic conscience in their vessel's head to a vicious entity that only consider vessels to be their body. Many types of Brain Worms tolerate or even embrace their vessel's Free Will, and some allow those without an infection to live on special reservations where they are without need. Others do the opposite, and still others only consider rulers worthy of being vessels while the rest toil. \nNo one Brain Worm species is alike, and all treat their Vessels differently.  \n\n§RNote:§!
